# Symptoms UI Overview

The iOS dashboard now surfaces user symptom logging end to end:

- **Symptoms tile**: Displays today’s logged count, queued offline entries, and a 30-day sparkline coloured by mean severity.
- **Quick logging sheet**: Provides preset buttons (Nerve pain, Zaps, Drained, Headache, Anxious, Insomnia, Other) with optional severity (1–5) and free-text notes.
- **Offline queue**: Events are saved locally when offline and automatically flushed on launch or refresh.
- **Trend overlays**: Weekly trend charts now show soft bands for days with high symptom activity.
