## 2024-04-05 — Features endpoint cache hardening

- Guarded `/v1/features/today` against pgBouncer pool exhaustion by attempting a manual connection acquisition and falling back to the last-good cache snapshot when the pool is saturated.
- Extended diagnostics with `cache_fallback`, `pool_timeout`, and `error` markers so client teams can detect when cached data was served.
- Added automated tests covering the new cache fallback branch and updated docs describing the behavior.
